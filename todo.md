## Large loop-like queries
I need to perform a query to apply a marketing attribution rule. In my mind this means finding all conversions for a KPI, then looping over each customer journey to apply the rule. Is there any alternative?

## Multiple users
Ask Jordan - how can I allow users to inject their own data sources into Presto? Catalogs? Is that secure?
